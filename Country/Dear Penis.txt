This song I'm gonna share with you It's called a letter to my penis y'all
Dear penis, I don't think I like you anymore
You used to watch me shave, now all you do is stare at the floor
Ohhhh dear penis, I don't like you anymore
Used to be you and me, a paper towel and a dirty magazine
That's all we needed to get by
Now It seems things have changed, I think that you're the one to blame
Dear penis I don't like you anymoreHe sings, dear Rodney, I don't think I like you anymore
Cause when you get to drinkin', you put me places I've never been before
Dear Rodney, I don't like you anymore
Why cant we just get a grip on our man to hand relationship
Come to terms truly how we feel
If we put our heads together we could just stay home forever
Dear penis, I think I like you after all
Oh hey Rodney, while your shavin', shave my balls
