I've seen the Joshua Tree
Got down on my knees
To the Virgin Mother I prayed
I've walked glass barefooted
Strolled 'cross the devil's hot coal
I've tried everything, I swearOh but hey, what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey, what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man(Poo poo poo-poo-poo-poo-poo)Fortune teller told me
"No more last chances
"You got no future at all"
Oh but I ain't listenin'
You black-hearted gypsy
with a crucifix through her bedroom wallHey, what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
I said hey, what can I say?
I'm just a desperate man(Poo poo poo-poo-poo-poo-poo)

(Poo poo poo-poo-poo-poo-poo)
(Poo poo poo-poo poo poo poo)Yeah I'm a half-cock, full-tilt, scarred-hands-to-the-hilt
Don't-push-me grown-ass man
Yeah flashin' light, caution, careful where ya cross her
'Til she comes back againYeah hey, what can I say?
I'm a desperate man
Oh hey, what can I say?
